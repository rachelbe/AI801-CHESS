# Chess Game with AI

## Description
This Python-based chess game features a graphical user interface and an AI opponent. The AI uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make decisions, providing a challenging chess experience. The game is built using Pygame and python-chess libraries.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- python-chess

## Installation
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Install Pygame and python-chess libraries using pip:
   ```
   pip install pygame python-chess
   ```

## Usage
Run the script to start the game. Use the mouse to interact with the chess pieces. The AI, playing as black (represented in red), will respond to your moves.

## Features
- Graphical chessboard and pieces.
- Mouse interaction for piece movement.
- AI opponent using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning.
- Legal move highlights and piece selection.
- Detection of checkmate and stalemate scenarios.

## Code Structure
Each function in the code has a specific purpose, from initializing the game, drawing the board and pieces, handling user interactions, to running the AI logic. The AI's decision-making is based on evaluating the chessboard and calculating the best move using a depth-limited minimax algorithm.
